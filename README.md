# ShayCrypt
my cryptographic algorithm that incorporates different algorithms together 

notes for use:
1. make sure that plaintext ends with "#ENDOFDATA#"
2. note that kt for use is by the encryptor and has doubles in it
3. case sensitive, space sensitive ...
4. when saving data (ed, tpl), save as bytes and for decrypting just read it as bytes again and pass to shay_decrypt()
